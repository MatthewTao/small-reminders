# small-reminders

There are lots of little things that should be done throughout the day:

- Move about
- staying hydrated

So this this little thingy feeds little reminders throughout the day.

## How to use

Below are the steps to start using the small reminders.

1. Create a `config.ini` file based on `config.ini.example`.
2. Run `gui.pyw`

## Yet to Implement

The gui at the moment just tracks when you have done the actions last,
and provides a quick way to track them.
But it still doesn't actually remind you to do them.
Perhaps a small message should pop up or there could be a audio cue.
